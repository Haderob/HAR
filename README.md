HAR- Human Activity Recognition using XGBoost classifier 

We built a demo for the wearable sensor-based HAR system using Streamlit, which is a Python library that allows us to create and share interactive web applications. Streamlit makes it easy to display the data.

Based on the findings and discussions presented in our project, it is evident that innovating wearable technologies for healthcare in sports is a relevant and critical area of research. Our project highlights the importance of wearable sensors and human activity recognition (HAR) technology in sports, which can help prevent injuries, enhance athletes’ performance, and optimize healthcare services. The integration of wearable sensors with HAR technology enables real-time data collection and analysis, providing insights into athletes’ health status and training levels. Additionally, our project emphasizes the significant role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the implementation and optimization of wearable technologies in sports.

Our discussion on how to apply this system in Africa highlights the need for collaboration between different stakeholders, including athletes, coaches, healthcare providers, and policymakers. This collaboration will facilitate the adoption of wearable technologies in sports and address the challenges, including limited resources and infrastructure in developing countries.

# HAR System Prototype Showcase
We have built a demo for the wearable sensor based HAR system using Streamlit, which is a Python library that allows us to create and share interactive web applications. Streamlit makes it easy to display the data, the recognition algorithms and models, and the results of the system in a user-friendly way. The input of the system is sensor data from smartphone sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope), which capture the movements and behaviors of the participants. The output of the system is human activity recognition, which classifies the sensor data into 18 different activities, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, etc. We used a dataset from Kaggle called KU-HAR, which contains information on 18 different activities collected from 90 participants using smartphone sensors. We trained the data for the system on Google Colab, which is a cloud service that provides free access to GPUs and TPUs for machine learning. Google Colab enables us to run and share our code in a notebook environment without installing anything on our local machine. We used XGBoost, which is a scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting trees, as the machine learning method for the recognition task. By using Streamlit, Google Colab, and XGBoost, we were able to create and showcase a working prototype of the wearable sensor based HAR system.

In summary, our project underscores the importance of innovating wearable technologies for healthcare in sports, particularly in developing countries like Africa. With the integration of wearable sensors and HAR technology, athletes’ health status can be monitored, injuries prevented, and healthcare services optimized. The implementation of this system requires collaboration among stakeholders, addressing the challenges, and future research to optimize the system."
